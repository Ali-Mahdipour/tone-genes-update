# The World Phonotactics Database (WPHON)

At the time of this writing (April 2020) the WPHON is no longer available online, so I used the latest available snapshot on **Internet Archive**/**WayBackMachine** from 8 June 2019, available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20190608215845/http://phonotactics.anu.edu.au/features.php](https://web.archive.org/web/20190608215845/http://phonotactics.anu.edu.au/features.php), marked as "Updated:  4 May 2017".

It "[...] includes phonotactic data on over 2000 languages, and segmental data for an additional 1700", and the listed [features](https://web.archive.org/web/20190608215845/http://phonotactics.anu.edu.au/features.php) are:

## The actual data

The actual data is available from [https://web.archive.org/web/20141022165943/http://phonotactics.anu.edu.au/qtp/wphon-latest.js](https://web.archive.org/web/20141022165943/http://phonotactics.anu.edu.au/qtp/wphon-latest.js)

## Conversion to CSV

I adapted the Python script `phonotactics.py` available from [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/xflr6/800401204fe15a6d1b9289149725b790) to use this latest snapshot currently available: the script is called `download_and_convert_WPD.py`.
